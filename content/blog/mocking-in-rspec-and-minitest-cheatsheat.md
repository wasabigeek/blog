My first exposure to testing in Ruby / Rails was through RSpec, but I'm now using Minitest. It wasn't immediately obvious how to translate rspec-expectations and rspec-mocks to Minitest, so here's my attempt at a cheatsheet:

| RSpec                                       | minitest with [mocha](https://github.com/freerange/mocha)                                                                                                                               | minitest with [minitest/mocks](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest#mocks-)                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Additional Note: Rails minitest is slightly different from pure Minitest https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html.

It's very possible I've gotten something wrong - please feel free to correct in the comments or submit a PR!
