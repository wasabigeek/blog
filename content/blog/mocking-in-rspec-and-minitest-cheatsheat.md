My first exposure to testing in Ruby / Rails was through RSpec, but I'm now using Minitest. It wasn't immediately obvious how to translate rspec-expectations and rspec-mocks to Minitest, so here's my attempt at a cheatsheet:

| RSpec                                       | minitest with [mocha](https://github.com/freerange/mocha)                                                                                                                               | minitest with [minitest/mocks](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest#mocks-)                                                                                                                                                                                               |
