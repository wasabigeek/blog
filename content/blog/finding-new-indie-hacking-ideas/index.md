A curated list of articles and resources for finding Indie Hacking ideas.

### **[How do you create a product people want to buy?](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-do-you-create-a-product-people-want-to-buy-a28b69ebb3) - *Amy Hoy***
*Note: The link is to a summary on IndieHackers*

Amy's suggestion for finding ideas is to pick a target market, find where they commune online and spend 30-50 hours reading through their pain points, beliefs, worldviews, complaints etc. I find this somewhat attractive since it doesn't require actually talking to anyone, but that could be a flaw. Will be trying this out.

### **[Trends and Opportunities for Building a SaaS in 2020](https://podcasts.apple.com/sg/podcast/the-indie-hackers-podcast/id1206165808#episodeGuid=d410b5d9-49e6-4073-8b12-91681223ea3f) - *IndieHackers Podcast #178***

Biggest takeaway was Rob Walling's ["Stair-Step Approach"](https://robwalling.com/2015/03/26/the-stairstep-approach-to-bootstrapping/) - start with one-time sale, single channel (e.g. an "info" product or productized service) to build confidence. Some other interesting discussions:
- building an audience is an advantage for info-products, but not so much for SaaS
- do you want competitor-pain (market is established, you figure out how to compete) or customer-pain (market is nascent, you will have to do a lot of customer education)?
- a "scratch your own itch" idea can be misleading, remember to still validate first
