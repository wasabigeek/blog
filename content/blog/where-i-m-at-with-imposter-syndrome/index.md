A recent conversation caused me to reflect on  my relationship with imposter syndrome. As recent as 2 years ago, my reaction could be summed up as a sort of depression. When I saw an indie hacker sharing their success story, or saw an (often younger) dev who seemed to be so far ahead, I mentally tortured myself. Why couldn't I be like that?

Now, I think I've achieved a somewhat steady state, at least in the area of web development: I still get imposter syndrome, but less, and for the most part my reaction to it has improved. What's been helpful so far?

## Remembering that we don't see the journey they took to get there
It's super easy to be focused on what others are better at, without remembering that they may have taken time to get there (and they likely struggled, just like you are struggling now).

I paired recently with @vinistock at work and was amazed by (from my perspective) his deep knowledge of Ruby internals like singleton classes and module hooks. What helped demystify it was asking:
- did he have this knowledge when he joined his current team a year ago? Answer: No, in fact, it was a struggle to learn.
- what resources did he use to get better, which he graciously shared. This helped me to chart a sort of "path to improvement".

My current take: there are probably geniuses out there who grasp things immediately, but for the majority of us, it's about working to get better, and hanging in there.

## Realising they made some learning tradeoffs
Dan Abramov (a public figure in the React community) has written about [things he doesn't know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/). I've found this helpful because it's easy to focus on what people know deeply about, and forget that they may have made learning tradeoffs to get there. There's things they don't know! (Which you may know, wow!)

## Getting more comfortable with feedback
@bethcodes has characterised [imposter syndrome as a lack of feedback](https://blog.bethcodes.com/confidence-through-feedback), and presented the dangers of choosing not to seek it. Seeking feedback is risky, we can look stupid, get laughed at, and the like. But when constructive, it leads to one of two things:
- learning what you can improve in
- learning that you're not as terrible as you think

Even with rational understanding of the above and a safe environment, it took me time and repetition to grow more comfortable with putting myself out there (be it "asking stupid questions" or seeking feedback). It's been important for me to find an environment where radical candour (TODO) is encouraged, but aside from that I don't think there are shortcuts to taking a leap of faith, again and again 🤔.

My favourite passage from @bethcode's post:
> On and on, my stupidity was laid bare for the world to see and it turned out it didn’t matter. No one cared, and when I took the feedback on board for next time they thought it was awesome.

On a somewhat related note, working with different people helped as well, as it became clearer that the positive feedback wasn't one-off. Plus, if many different people are saying similar things, it becomes harder for you to refute. For me, this became clearer when I changed jobs - I really enjoyed my previous company actually, but kept wrestling with my standing in the industry. (I wouldn't take this at face value though, depending on you / your company you might be able to achieve similar results without leaving!)

## Reframing as something you can improve in
I feel a little cheesy saying this - reframing the subject of my imposter syndrome as something improvable has had the most impact over the last few years. A key catalyst for this was reading Carol Dweck's Mindset.

One particular example from the book that sticks with me - children were given a set of puzzles to see how they dealt with difficulty:

> Confronted with the hard puzzles, one ten-year-old boy pulled up his chair, rubbed his hands together, smacked his lips, and cried out, “I love a challenge!”
> ...
> What’s wrong with them? I wondered. I always thought you coped with failure or you didn’t cope with failure. I never thought anyone loved failure.
> ...
> Not only weren’t they discouraged by failure, they didn’t even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.

When inadequacy or jealousy creeps in, I try now to think of the subject as something I can get better in, as opposed to being something impossible. I avoid thinking about whether I can achieve the same level of expertise, just reminding myself that I can get better. I literally imagine and try to emulate a kid saying, "Whoa, that's awesome! Let me try."

Again, it's not something that changed overnight, and I'm still working on it.

## All the best!
If you're struggling with imposter syndrome, I hope some of this helps. I don't think it's something that completely goes away, and will probably spike when I'm faced with more drastic role changes. Fingers-crossed that these coping mechanisms will carry through!
