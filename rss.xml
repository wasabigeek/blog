&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“become a regular open source contributor”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation was to experience different codebases to gain more experience and (hopefully) improve my employability. 5 months on, I feel reasonably comfortable stating that I’m an open source contributor, and hope to continue doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of my journey so far, I hope it’ll be useful for you, especially if you’re thinking of contributing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Timers Only&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, I remembered reading about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kentcdodds.com/blog/first-timers-only&quot;&gt;first timers “movement”&lt;/a&gt; and quickly found a compilation of participating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt;. Ruby was what we used at work, so I jumped to that section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38220&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; I tried to submit was for Rails (seemed like it would be something nice on the resume). Rails uses the label &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/labels/good%20first%20issue&quot;&gt;good first issue&lt;/a&gt;, so I picked an issue near the top, spent a Saturday working and submitted it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good things…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, that issue was not a great first pick. It already had some attempts, with the most recent just a week before my PR. I think I was so unsure of myself, I figured this would be a super low-risk issue to try. After all, if I screwed it up, there were other attempts that could be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, one of the maintainers took it upon himself to close the issue and credited all the contributors. His PR was better, but I guess it was mainly a way of navigating this long-drawn issue without stepping on any toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting, I decided to try again. We were using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/99designs/iamy&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; written in Go to manage our AWS IAM at work, but there was a good-to-have feature we wanted and an issue for it. So I spent a few week nights and weekends learning Go, doing up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/99designs/iamy/pull/69&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; and submitting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…come to those…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And someone reviewed! I was energised. I made some changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he requested a second opinion from another maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still there, open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was starting to get disheartened. (No hate to open source maintainers, it’s pretty thankless work and the world is better for your contributions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…who &lt;del&gt;wait&lt;/del&gt; keep trying.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flapped around a bit, and one day decided to look at another gem our company had been using. I saw a pretty steady stream of merges, neatly labelled issues, plus it just felt less intimidating than Rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/pull/244&quot;&gt;first merge&lt;/a&gt;! I was elated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge props to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dblock&quot;&gt;dblock&lt;/a&gt;, who somehow manages to turnaround and reply quickly, often within a day or two. Rubyists, if you would love to contribute but don’t know where to, might I humbly suggest anyone of dblock’s projects - it’s a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For “first timers” looking to contribute, my takeaways (sample size of 1, take with a pinch of salt):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labels on recent issues seemed like a good sign that a project is well-maintained. Search for a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;first-timers-only&lt;/code&gt; type label - for example, in Rails it was &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;good first issue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/code&gt; documentation first before starting on your PR! There’s usually a lot of helpful setup stuff there. For example, Rails was pretty amazing for this, I was kinda worried going in but it was really smooth, they even had instructions on how to use Vagrant to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expect a little trial-and-error to getting your first PR merged, but stick with it! I found the experience super rewarding, and indeed got exposure to different codebases and languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make life as easy for maintainers as possible - try to figure out as much as you can first, whether it’s looking at previous PRs, making GitHub checks pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that was helpful! Feel free to drop a note on Twitter to discuss / disagree :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
