Ruby was what we used at work, so I jumped to that section.</p>\n<p>The first <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38220\">PR</a> I tried to submit was for Rails (seemed like it would be something nice on the resume). Rails uses the label <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/labels/good%20first%20issue\">good first issue</a>, so I picked an issue near the top, spent a Saturday working and submitted it!</p>\n<p>Then I waited.</p>\n<p>And waited.</p>\n<h2>Good things…</h2>\n<p>In hindsight, that issue was not a great first pick. It already had some attempts, with the most recent just over a week from when I made the PR. I think I was just so unsure of myself, I wanted to try it anyway to see if I could actually do this thing. If I screwed it up, there were already a few attempts anyhow.</p>\n<p>In the end, one of the maintainers took it upon himself to close the issue and credited all the contributors. His PR was really a lot better, so I guess it was a way of navigating this long-drawn issue without stepping on any toes.</p>\n<p>While waiting, I decided to try again. We were using a <a href=\"https://github.com/99designs/iamy\">tool</a> written in Go to manage our AWS IAM at work, but there was a good-to-have feature we wanted and an issue for it. So I spent a few week nights and weekends learning Go, doing up the <a href=\"https://github.com/99designs/iamy/pull/69\">PR</a> and submitting it.</p>\n<p>Then I waited.</p>\n<h2>…come to those…</h2>\n<p>And someone reviewed! I was energised. I made some changes.</p>\n<p>Then he requested a second opinion from another maintainer.</p>\n<p>It’s still there, open.</p>\n<p>At this point I was starting to get disheartened. No hate to open source maintainers, it’s pretty thankless work and the world is better for your contributions.</p>\n<h2>…who wait.</h2>\n<p>I flapped around a bit, and one day decided to look at another gem our company had been using. I saw a pretty steady stream of merges, neatly labelled issues, plus it just felt less intimidating than Rails.</p>\n<p>A few days later, my <a href=\"https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/pull/244\">first merge</a>! I was elated.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 518px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a6a8e9110ff40b0c37628a8d0267e82e/6b9fd/slackrubymerge.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 14.18918918918919%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAADCAYAAACTWi8uAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAkUlEQVQI16WOWw6CMBRE2f8a3IUr8UtDwASVd0l4FNrbAseCS3CSmZN7Mx8TVZnGi8EYgxXBe48EirjzNsayLAvGWpxfsW5F3EF/0offry/s+050vSSk9xvxIyZJnxRlRV03tKo7XRQlWfairGq6XvNRM3nwuxnJ24lx0qhWoUJ33TaiI+awYBgn+n5A65l/9AUqoudHHa/43AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"First Merge!\"\n        title=\"First Merge!\"\n        src=\"/static/a6a8e9110ff40b0c37628a8d0267e82e/6b9fd/slackrubymerge.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a6a8e9110ff40b0c37628a8d0267e82e/12f09/slackrubymerge.png 148w,\n/static/a6a8e9110ff40b0c37628a8d0267e82e/e4a3f/slackrubymerge.png 295w,\n/static/a6a8e9110ff40b0c37628a8d0267e82e/6b9fd/slackrubymerge.png 518w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Huge props to <a href=\"https://github.com/dblock\">dblock</a>, who somehow manages to turnaround and reply quickly, often within a day or two. Rubyists, if you would love to contribute but don’t know where to, might I humbly suggest anyone of dblock’s projects - it’s a great place to start.</p>\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>My takeaways (sample size of 1, take with a pinch of salt):</p>\n<p><strong>Would-Be-Maintainers</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Labelled issues were very helpful to me, I think it would make it a lot easier to get new contributors when issues are triaged and labelled (especially with a <code class=\"language-text\">first-timers-only</code> type label).</li>\n<li>Have a <code class=\"language-text\">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> documentation. For example, Rails was pretty amazing for this, I was kinda worried going in but it was really smooth, they even had instructions on how to use Vagrant to get started. It helps newbies!</li>\n<li>In the absence of timely review, any comment helps, a lot. I know it’s unfair to expect you to be devoting loads of time as a maintainer, especially if it’s a project you don’t use anymore. I can only speak from my experience as a contributor - it made a huge difference in motivation.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye out for new maintainers to share your burden. Easier said than done, so maybe I’d best refer you to <a href=\"https://github.com/dblock\">dblock</a>. I feel he does this well - after contributing for a few months, he reached out and asked if I would like to be a contributor on one repo, to reduce the bus factor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Would-Be-Contributors</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expect a little trial-and-error to getting your first PR merged, but stick with it! I found the experience super rewarding, and indeed got exposure to different codebases and languages.</li>\n<li>Make life as easy for maintainers as possible - try to figure out as much as you can first, whether it’s looking at previous PRs, making GitHub checks pass.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope that was helpful!
