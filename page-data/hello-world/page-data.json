Both looked promising, and I figured I’d start with Ruby, since that was the language I had most experience with.</p>\n<p>The first project I tried submitting a PR for was Rails (that would be something nice on the resume). I searched for a first timers tag, spent a Saturday working on it, submitted it!</p>\n<p>Then I waited.</p>\n<p>And waited.</p>\n<p>After a month or so, I decided I would try to contribute elsewhere. There was a tool we were using at work, we wanted a feature and there was an issue for it, so I spent a few weeknights and weekends learning Go, doing up the PR and submitting it.</p>\n<p>Then I waited.</p>\n<p>And someone reviewed! I was energised. I made some changes. Then he requested a second opinion from another maintainer.</p>\n<p>It’s still there, open.</p>\n<p>By this point I was quite disheartened. No hate to open source maintainers, it’s pretty thankless work and the world is better for their contributions. Still.</p>\n<p>I flapped around a bit, before looking at another repo, another tool that our company had been using. This time I saw a pretty steady stream of merges, the issues were labelled nicely, and it wasn’t as intimidating as Rails was.</p>\n<p>A few days later, my first merge!</p>\n<p>I was elated. Huge props to dblock, who is pretty on the ball in reviewing and merging.</p>\n<p>Rubyists, if you would love to contribute but don’t know where to, might I humbly suggest anyone of dblock’s projects - it’s a great place to start.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Steps into Open Source","date":"May 06, 2020","description":"First Steps into Open Source"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
