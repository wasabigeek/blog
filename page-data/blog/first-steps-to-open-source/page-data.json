Ruby was what we used at work, so I jumped to that section.</p>\n<p>The first <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38220\">PR</a> I tried to submit was for Rails (seemed like it would be something nice on the resume). Rails uses the label <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/labels/good%20first%20issue\">good first issue</a>, so I picked an issue near the top, spent a Saturday working and submitted it!</p>\n<p>Then I waited.</p>\n<p>And waited.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-things\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#good-things\" aria-label=\"good things permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Good things…</h2>\n<p>In hindsight, that issue was not a great first pick. It already had some attempts, with the most recent just a week before my PR. I think I was so unsure of myself, I figured this would be a super low-risk issue to try. After all, if I screwed it up, there were other attempts that could be picked up.</p>\n<p>In the end, one of the maintainers took it upon himself to close the issue and credited all the contributors. His PR was better, but I guess it was mainly a way of navigating this long-drawn issue without stepping on any toes.</p>\n<p>While waiting, I decided to try again. We were using a <a href=\"https://github.com/99designs/iamy\">tool</a> written in Go to manage our AWS IAM at work, but there was a good-to-have feature we wanted and an issue for it. So I spent a few week nights and weekends learning Go, doing up the <a href=\"https://github.com/99designs/iamy/pull/69\">PR</a> and submitting it.</p>\n<p>Then I waited.</p>\n<h2 id=\"come-to-those\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#come-to-those\" aria-label=\"come to those permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>…come to those…</h2>\n<p>And someone reviewed! I was energised. I made some changes.</p>\n<p>Then he requested a second opinion from another maintainer.</p>\n<p>It’s still there, open.</p>\n<p>At this point I was starting to get disheartened. (No hate to open source maintainers, it’s pretty thankless work and the world is better for your contributions.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-wait-keep-trying\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#who-wait-keep-trying\" aria-label=\"who wait keep trying permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>…who <del>wait</del> keep trying.</h2>\n<p>I flapped around a bit, and one day decided to look at another gem our company had been using. I saw a pretty steady stream of merges, neatly labelled issues, plus it just felt less intimidating than Rails.</p>\n<p>A few days later, my <a href=\"https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/pull/244\">first merge</a>!

Search for a <code class=\"language-text\">first-timers-only</code> type label - for example, in Rails it was <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code>.</li>\n<li>Check the <code class=\"language-text\">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> documentation first before starting on your PR! There’s usually a lot of helpful setup stuff there. For example, Rails was pretty amazing for this, I was kinda worried going in but it was really smooth, they even had instructions on how to use Vagrant to get started.</li>\n<li>Expect a little trial-and-error to getting your first PR merged, but stick with it! I found the experience super rewarding, and indeed got exposure to different codebases and languages.</li>\n<li>Make life as easy for maintainers as possible - try to figure out as much as you can first, whether it’s looking at previous PRs, making GitHub checks pass.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope that was helpful!
