Will be trying this out.</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/sg/podcast/the-indie-hackers-podcast/id1206165808#episodeGuid=d410b5d9-49e6-4073-8b12-91681223ea3f\">Trends and Opportunities for Building a SaaS in 2020</a> - <em>IndieHackers Podcast #178</em></strong></h3>\n<p>Biggest takeaway was Rob Walling’s <a href=\"https://robwalling.com/2015/03/26/the-stairstep-approach-to-bootstrapping/\">“Stair-Step Approach”</a> - start with one-time sale, single channel (e.g. an “info” product or productized service) to build confidence. Some other interesting discussions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>building an audience is an advantage for info-products, but not so much for SaaS</li>\n<li>do you want competitor-pain (market is established, you figure out how to compete) or customer-pain (market is nascent, you will have to do a lot of customer education)?</li>\n<li>a “scratch your own itch” idea can be misleading, remember to still validate first</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finding New Indie Hacking Ideas (WIP)","date":"December 13, 2020","description":"My curated list of articles and resources to get started on finding your next Indie Hacking project.
